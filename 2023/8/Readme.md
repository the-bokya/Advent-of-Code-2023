## Note

Today's problem had a problem with the input where, for part 2, all the locations ending with 'Z' are reached in equal cycles and are multiples of the number of instructions. This makes it easier than projected and one can just count the number of steps till each 'Z' is reached for each location starting with 'A' and then find the LCM of all of them, which is what I observed in the first place and what my program does.
